= People's Liberation Training Committee Organization Documents

== Purpose
In an age of collapsing captialism, it is crucial to build an organization that educates the working class in their defense-both against the political propaganda of the ruling class and against any physical threats they may encounter.

This document serves to outline the mission, goals, and organizational structure of the People's Liberation Training Committee (PLT-COM).
