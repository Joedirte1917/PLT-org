# New Chapter Formation

#### Initial Contact
First, fill out the new member form on the website. Within a few days the Director of Chapter Organizing (DCO) will be in contact with you. If you're the first member in the state, you will become the chapter point person. Don't worry, this isn't a leadership position, and our DCO will help you through the process as you go.

#### Growing the Chapter
After connecting with the DCO, you'll be given credentials to our communications platform where you can create a profile. As the point person, you'll also have access to the chapter email. You and the DCO will get a copy of all new member requests for your area, and will coordinate vetting appointments and dues payments for those new members.

Key to the mission of the PLT-COM is integration with local parties. The DCO will help you coordinate meetings with your local party (if you're not already connected), and lay the groundwork for recruitment from the local parties.

#### Chapter Ratification
Once your chapter has 5 members, you can officially meet and ratify your chapter. All area members should meet, and elect a chapter director. The chapter director will take over as the point person, including the chapter email and other duties of the point person.

#### Forming Committees
Chapters should the following committees, in the following order:
* Firearms Education Committees
* Political Education Committee
* First Aid Committee
