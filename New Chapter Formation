# New Chapter Formation

#### Initial Contact
First, fill out the new member form on the website. Within a few days the Director of Chapter Organizing (DCO) will be in contact with you. If you're the first member in the state, you will become the chapter point person. Don't worry, this isn't a leadership position, and our DCO will help you through the process as you go.

#### Growing the Chapter
After connecting with the DCO, you'll be given credentials to our communications platform where you can create a profile. As the point person, you'll also have access to the chapter email. You, the DCO, and your regional director (RD) will get a copy of all new member requests for your area, and will coordinate vetting appointments and dues payments for those new members.

Key to the mission of the PLT-COM is integration with local parties. The DCO and RD will help you coordinate meetings with your local party (if you're not already connected), and lay the groundwork for recruitment from the local parties.

#### Chapter Ratification
Once your chapter has 5 members, you can officially meet and ratify your chapter. All area members should meet, and elect a chapter director. The chapter director will take over as the point person, including the chapter email and other duties of the point person.

To continue as chapter director, the chapter director must meet and fulfill the chapter director requirements within their first term. 

#### Forming Committees
Chapters should create the following committees:
* Firearms Education Committees
* First Aid Committee
* Political Education Committer

While the chapter is still small, the focus should be on creating a firearms education committee. The DCO, RD, and national firearms director will help coordinate the committeeâ€™s creation and help facilitate your first class-basic firearms handling and operation.

###### Firearms Education Committee (FEC)
PLT-COM's Firearms Education Program is our niche offering to the local left, and as such should be the first committee off the ground.  The local FEC is lead by a chapter firearms director (CFD), who sits on the national firearms education committee (NFEC), which is headed by the national firearms director (NFD). The CFD is in charge of implementing decisions made at the NFEC in your local chapter. 

###### Political Education Committee (PEC)
Part of PLT-COMs goal is to provide political education to the masses. This role may be better served by a party, but we can serve as a more accessible entry point than some parties, and likewise can provide basic political education in the absence of a local party. Towards this goal, chapters should form a political education committee (PEC). The local PEC is headed by the chapter political education director (CPED), who sits on the national political education committee (NPEC), which is led by the national political education director (NPED). The CPED is responsible for implementing the decisions of the NPEC at the chapter level.

###### First Aid Education Committee (FAEC)
Handling firearms and first aid go hand in hand. Firearms are dangerous, and as such we should learn how to handle injuries caused by them. The chapter First Aid Education Committee (CFAEC) is responsible for providing training in CPR, managing gunshot wounds and other massive hemorrhages, basic first aid, and treatment of chemical exposure. The CFAEC is led by the chapter first aid director (CFAD), who sits on the national first aid education committee (NFAEC), which is lead by the national first aid
